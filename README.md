# CLIFFS

Command Line Interface For Finding Stuff

Usage: The search will take any number of json file paths as command line arguments

e.g. to compile and run from the command line from the src directory:
>$ javac -cp "com/company/json-simple-1.1.1.jar" com/company/Cliffs.java  
>$ java -cp "com/company/json-simple-1.1.1.jar" com/company/Cliffs.java ./com/company/users.json ./com/company/organizations.json ./com/company/tickets.json
 
Then, follow on-screen instructions to select which type of records you want to search, followed by which field to search, and finally, search term.
